take a non stick pan and heat it up.
add some butter.
when it is heated add  the marinated paneer, capsicum and onion.
saute it until it is golden brown.
                             
                             ready to serve

Methor 2-For cooking direct on gas:-

take a iron rod. 
in rod add a piece of raw potato.
now add marinated paneer, capsicum and onion.
again add a piece of potato (we added potato at the end and in the beggening so that it will not fell down and it will stay moist).
now on high flame heat the paneer till it shows tandoori effect(means brown black marks).
now it is ready to serve.
                          
you can also heat the panner a bit so that when you want to serve it you can cook it on gas for 30 sec and it will be ready.
